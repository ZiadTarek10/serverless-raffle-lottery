# serverless-raffle-lottery

This project implements a serverless application using various AWS services such as API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Route 53, IAM, CloudWatch, CloudFront, S3, and ACM. The application allows users to enter their name, email, and phone number to participate in a raffle/lottery. Upon drawing, the application displays the total number of applicants and selects three winners. The entire setup is automated with Terraform for seamless infrastructure deployment.
